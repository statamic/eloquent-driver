# Statamic Eloquent Driver

<!-- statamic:hide -->

> Provides support for storing your Statamic data in a database, rather than flat files.

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

## Installation & Usage

You can install and configure the Eloquent Driver using a single command:

```
php please install:eloquent-driver
```

The command will install the `statamic/eloquent-driver` package, publish the config file, then prompt you to select which repositories you wish to move to the database. The command will then publish the relevant migrations and run `php artisan migrate` behind the scenes.

The command will also give you the opportunity to indicate whether you'd like existing data to be imported.

### Importing flat-file content

If you originally opt-out of importing existing content, then later change your mind, you can import existing content by running the relevant commands:

- Assets: `php please eloquent:import-assets`
- Blueprints and Fieldsets: `php please eloquent:import-blueprints`
- Collections: `php please eloquent:import-collections`
- Entries: `php please eloquent:import-entries`
- Forms: `php please eloquent:import-forms`
- Globals: `php please eloquent:import-globals`
- Navs: `php please eloquent:import-navs`
- Revisions: `php please eloquent:import-revisions`
- Taxonomies: `php please eloquent:import-taxonomies`
- Sites: `php please eloquent:import-sites`

### Syncing Assets

If your assets are being driven by the Eloquent Driver and you're managing your assets outside of Statamic (eg. directly in the filesystem), you should run the `php please eloquent:sync-assets` command to add any missing files to the database, and remove files that no longer exist on the filesystem.

### Exporting to flat files

If you wish to move back to flat-files, you may use the following commands to export your content out of the database:

- Assets: `php please eloquent:export-assets`
- Blueprints and Fieldsets: `php please eloquent:export-blueprints`
- Collections: `php please eloquent:export-collections`
- Entries: `php please eloquent:export-entries`
- Forms: `php please eloquent:export-forms`
- Globals: `php please eloquent:export-globals`
- Navs: `php please eloquent:export-navs`
- Revisions: `php please eloquent:export-revisions`
- Taxonomies: `php please eloquent:export-taxonomies`
- Sites: `php please eloquent:export-sites`

## Configuration

The configuration file, found in `config/statamic/eloquent-driver.php` is automatically published when you install the Eloquent Driver. 

For each of the repositories, it allows you to determine if they should be driven by flat-files (`file`) or Eloquent (`eloquent`). Some repositories also have additional options, like the ability to override the model used.

### Using dedicated columns for data

> Note: This feature is currently only available for Entries.

By default, the Eloquent Driver stores all data in a single `data` column. However, it is possible to store fields in their own columns. 

1. First, you'll need to enable the `map_data_to_columns` option in the `entries` section of the configuration file:

    ```php
    // config/statamic/eloquent-driver.php
    
    'entries' => [
        'driver' => 'file',
        'model' => \Statamic\Eloquent\Entries\EntryModel::class,
        'entry' => \Statamic\Eloquent\Entries\Entry::class,
        'map_data_to_columns' => false,
    ],
    ```

2. Create a new migration to add the columns to the `entries` table:
    ```bash
    php artisan make:migration add_columns_to_entries_table
    ```
    
    ```php
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('entries', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->string('description')->nullable();
            $table->json('featured_images')->nullable();
        });
    }
    ```
    
    You should ensure that the column names match the field handles in your blueprints. You should also ensure the column type matches that of the fieldtype. As a general rule of thumb, here are some common mappings:

   * Text fields should be stored as `string` columns.
   * Relationship fields should be stored as `json` columns. (Unless `max_items` is set to `1`, in which case it should be stored as a `string` column.)
   * Number fields should be stored as `integer` or `decimal` columns.

3. Run the migration:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

4. If you're adding `json` or `integer` columns, you will need to provide your own `Entry` model in order to set the appropriate casts. You can do this by creating a new model which extends the default `Entry` model:
    ```php
    <?php
    
    namespace App\Models;
    
    class Entry extends \Statamic\Eloquent\Entries\EntryModel
    {
        protected $casts = [
            // The casts from Statamic's base model...
            'date'      => 'datetime',
            'data'      => 'json',
            'published' => 'boolean',
    
            // Your custom casts...
            'featured_images' => 'json',
        ];
    }
    ```
    
    If you're using UUIDs as your entry IDs (which is the default if you imported existing entries into the database), you should extend the `Statamic\Eloquent\Entries\UuidEntryModel` class instead:
    
    ```php
    class Entry extends \Statamic\Eloquent\Entries\UuidEntryModel
    ```

5. If you have existing entries, you will need to re-save them to populate the new columns. You can do this by pasting the following snippet into `php artisan tinker`:
    ```php
    \Statamic\Facades\Entry::all()->each->save();
    ```

6. And that's it! Statamic will now read and write data to the new columns in the `entries` table, rather than the `data` column.

## Upgrading

After updating to a new version of the Eloquent Driver, please ensure you run `php artisan migrate` to update your database to the latest schema.

## Questions

### Can I store users in the database too?

By default, Statamic users live in the `users` directory of your project. If you wish to move them to the database, please [follow this guide](https://statamic.dev/tips/storing-users-in-a-database). 

### Can I store some collections in the database, while keeping others in flat-files?

This driver **does not** make it possible to have some collections flat-file driven and others Eloquent driven. If you're looking for that, you may want to checkout the [Runway](https://statamic.com/addons/rad-pack/runway) addon, which is part of The Rad Pack.
